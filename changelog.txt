8. July, 2007

- Fixed a bug in AddReservation where the engine would silently ignore wrongly
formatted extensions to the TPBs.  Effectively ignoring the reservations and
still not reporting any error.


7. May, 2007

- Methods Set/Get on char* have been dropped for security.  Though to ease the
handling of static buffers of chars (zero-terminated) and string literals new
methods have been added.  Those are template methods recognizing char[] and
using that knowledge to automatically enforce buffer limits and addition of the
terminating null on Get().

- Added an optional parameter to Database::Info to return wether the database
is currently in read-only mode or not.

- Updated release notes.  Updated copyright years in file headers.

- Changed the way the source code zip is built such as the zip does not unzip
anymore to the current directory but to a subdirectory.  This was often noted
by linux developers, specifically, thanks Milan :-)

- Did a big bunch of changes such as to eliminate all errors or warnings
reported by FlexeLint.  A ton of informational messages can still be reported
but very few hold really useful information for IBPP code quality.

- All "deprecated" methods whose fate was set for version 3.0 have already
been dropped, in advance.


6. July 23, 2006

********

- Work in progress regarding the introduction of the Driver interface.
The code found in the HEAD of trunk is not complete and not meant to work (yet)
if it was compiling (by any chance).

- Added management of interfaces and proper driver unloading (disconnecting
databases and services cleanly if required). A critical section around
DriverImpl::mInterfaces (std::set) handling is required but not implemented yet.

********

5. May 12, 2006

- Fixed a bug introduced with 2.5 code base regarding Commit and Rollback of
transaction which called CursorExecute() but didn't Fetch() anything. There was
a logic error in this whole scheme. This fix has also been introduced to 2.5
code base.

4. April 13, 2006

- Renamed Events::Clear() to Events::Drop()

3. April 12, 2006

- Back-ported the fix to events counts thanks to Michael Hieke from 2.5.2.1.

2. April 11, 2006

- Back-ported the drop of the asynchronous events model from 2.5.2.0 code base.

1. April 7, 2006

- 2.5 code base was branched to ibpp/branch/ibpp-2-5
- ibpp/trunk is now opened for new developments
