- Fixed an inconvenience when running under debugger. Upon some conditions the
private method StatementImpl::CursorFree() could throw. In those cases where it
could happen, it was caught internally, so the behaviour was correct, but this
occasional flow of exceptions was disturbing. Had to rework some logic and to
work-around a strange behaviour where a phantom cursor is implicitely opened
when a result set is fetched up to and including its last row.

- IBPP 2.5 has been released today, as of version 2.5.1.62.
