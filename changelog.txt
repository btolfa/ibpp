The most recent addition to this file is always on top and has the highest
item number.

26. May, 2007

- Methods Set/Get on char* have been dropped for security.  Though to ease the
handling of static buffers of chars (zero-terminated) and string literals new
methods have been added.  Those are template methods recognizing char[] and
using that knowledge to automatically enforce buffer limits and addition of the
terminating null on Get().

- Added an optional parameter to Database::Info to return wether the database
is currently in read-only mode or not.

- Updated release notes.  Updated copyright years in file headers.

- Changed the way the source code zip is built such as the zip does not unzip
anymore to the current directory but to a subdirectory.  This was often noted
by linux developers.

- Did a big bunch of changes such as to eliminate all errors or warnings
reported by FlexeLint.  A ton of informational messages can still be reported
but very few hold really useful information for IBPP code quality.

- All "deprecated" methods whose fate was set for version 3.0 have already
been dropped.

1. November, 2006

- Branched 2-5 to 2-6 to better track them. Version 2.6 will officially use the
header files from Firebird 2.0 (final released version).  Some new capabilities
will be added too, to perfectly match FB 2.0.
