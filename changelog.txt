Changed AddUser/ModifyUser/ListUsers (not backward compatible but easy to
upgrade) to use the new IBPP::User helper class.

Switched development to Subversion repository, now available at SourceForge.

IBPP project didn't required the added facilities of Subversion compared to CVS.
But, I, needed them. All my other projects (business projects) are hosted on
Subversion. So as the main contributor to the code, I egoistically opted to
simplify my developer's life. (O. Mascia).

- Fixed a wrong arithmetic overflow check in row.cpp. The bug surfaces only when
attempting to Get() a 64 bits integer from the DB to a 32 bits integer variable.

- Fixed a bug in SPB::InsertString leading to wrong behaviour on PPC processors.
(Thanks Michael Hieke.)
