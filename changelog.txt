item number.

9. March 15, 2006

- Code tweaks to bring back MSVC 6 compatibility:
  - Use std::string::erase() instead of std::string::clear()
  - #define for if(true)for  (this is activated only for MSVC6)
  
- Added a sample 'all_at_once.cpp' file including all others to streamline
quick and dirty command line compiles. Had to move out constants from the
unnamed namespace to allow this.

8. March 13, 2006

- Added some code in tests.cpp to better exercise cases where a Database
pointer if recycled (while still connected) for a new connection. This better
exercise the destructors and lifetime management of the interface pointers.

7. March 10, 2006

- Confining exceptions within destructors

6. March 8, 2006

- Decided to rework the Service methods to manage users. ListUsers() becomes
GetUsers() taking a single vector<User>& as parameter : cleaner. And added
GetUser() taking User& as parameter to get a single user infos.

- Fixed a bug in tests.cpp (ParameterType instead of ParameterSubtype). I
thought I fixed this one earlier. Missed commit, I guess.

5. March 7, 2006

- Some warning fixups using -W -Wall -pedantic with gcc.
- Fixup to the derivation of WrongTypeImpl exception.

4. March 5, 2006

- Added std::string& Statement::Sql() to return the last sql statement prepared/executed.

- When Statement Get() and Set() face an incompatible type situation, the exception report has
been enhanced to give the two conflicting types (the SQL column type and the variable data type).

- Added exception class 'WrongType' derived from 'LogicException' to support the above.


3. March 2, 2006

Changed AddUser/ModifyUser/ListUsers (not backward compatible but easy to
upgrade) to use the new IBPP::User helper class.


2. March 1, 2006

Switched development to Subversion repository, now available at SourceForge.

IBPP project didn't required the added facilities of Subversion compared to CVS.
But, I, needed them. All my other projects (business projects) are hosted on
Subversion. So as the main contributor to the code, I egoistically opted to
simplify my developer's life. (O. Mascia).


1. November 17, 2005

- Fixed a wrong arithmetic overflow check in row.cpp. The bug surfaces only when
attempting to Get() a 64 bits integer from the DB to a 32 bits integer variable.

- Fixed a bug in SPB::InsertString leading to wrong behaviour on PPC processors.
(Thanks Michael Hieke.)
