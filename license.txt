   IBPP LICENSE, Version 1.0   >>> STARTS HERE <<<
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Definitions

   0.1. IBPP
   
   'IBPP' is primarily a set of programming interfaces, initially written in
   the C++ language, which makes it easier to develop any other programming
   work which need to communicate and work with Firebird, a SQL-based database
   engine and server, and possibly other similar engines and servers.  Further
   in this document we also name 'IBPP' the source code itself which implements
   those interfaces and any associated files whatever their nature.

   0.2. TIP
   
   'TIP' is the company T.I.P. Group S.A., a legal entity, registered in the
   Kingdom of Belgium under the enterprise identification number 0.429.942.927.
   Contact information: http://www.tipgroup.com.

   0.3. Authors
   
   'Authors' is the college of private persons or legal entities, including
   TIP, who at least once contributed to IBPP.
   
   
1. Copyrights

The very initial version of IBPP (0.9) was released in the year 2000 by TIP.
Through this initial contribution, TIP holds a Copyright (c) 2000 on that
original version of IBPP.

In addition, each and every private person or legal entity, including TIP, who
since contributed or contribute to IBPP hold a shared Copyright (c) <year of
contribution> with TIP on that portion of code they contribute, wether the
contribution is made by modification or addition to the source code or
associated files.


2. Rights

Without damage of the duties exposed at article 3., the Authors hereby grant
the following permissions, free of charge, to any private person or legal
entity (hereafter "You"):

   2.1. Right to Use

   To use (edit when required, compile and link) the IBPP source code as part
   of a larger programming work which effectively makes use of some or all of
   the functionnalities offered by IBPP.

   2.2. Right to Modify

   To develop modifications or additions which enhance or fix IBPP.
   
   2.3. Right to Publish
   
   To publish the IBPP source code along with your own source code which uses
   it.


3. Duties

   3.1. Duty to give modifications back to IBPP Authors

   Any modification or addition done to IBPP will be submitted to the Authors,
   so that those modifications or additions can be reviewed, possibly modified
   or fixed, and eventually merged in a new version of IBPP, if the
   modification is found by the Authors to be of interest to the IBPP users
   community.
   
   3.2. Duty to play by the rules when publishing the IBPP source code
   
   When You publish the IBPP source code with your own source code which uses
   it, You must also publish this license.txt file and You must not remove any
   of the licensing and copyright texts located near the beginning of the IBPP
   source code files.

   3.3. Duty to free IBPP Authors from any responsability
   
   When You use IBPP in your programming works, You implicitely agree to free
   the Authors from any and all responsability.  You fully endorse IBPP and
   assume all consequences of using it in your programming works.  This goes
   to the extent that, should the IBPP code be found to infringe on the
   copyright or patent of any third-party entity, you assume the entire
   responsability regarding your own programming works which use IBPP.  You
   always a least have the final solution not to use IBPP anymore in your
   programming works.
   

4. New versions of this License

TIP is the only entity who can publish new versions of this license and attach
such new license versions to any future version of IBPP.  Though if doing so,
TIP cannot remove any right previously granted by this version 1.0 of the
license, nor can TIP add duties restricting those previous rights further.
New rights and / or duties might though be added if the nature of IBPP
(article 0.1) evolve in the future or if components of a different nature
are added to IBPP.  A new license version might also be required if some
words of this version needed to be corrected or changed to make things even
more clear and precise.


5. Disclaimer of Warranty

IBPP IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER
IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

o Can I use IBPP in any kind of closed-source programming work?
  
  YES. Nothing in the license forbids you of doing so.

o Can I use IBPP in any kind of commercial programming work, one for which
  a revenue is drawn from?
  
  YES. Nothing in the license forbids you of doing so.

o Am I obliged to publish my own source code when I use IBPP in that code?
  
  NO. You have no duty to publish your own code if it doesn't fit your needs.

o Can I package and sell copies of IBPP?
  
  NO. This right is not among the three rights granted by this license.
  
o Is the IBPP License compatible with <insert your choice of License here>?
  
  Probably. The IBPP license is so open-minded that it is hard to imagine how
  it could really conflict with any license applied to a larger work in which
  IBPP is used. In all cases, the burden of answering this question is on you.
  As long as your use complies with this license, you're ok for what concerns
  IBPP. Wether the reverse is ok for you, is all on you.

o I have made enhancements to IBPP but these are tightely coupled to closed-
  source portions of my application(s). Am I obliged to contribute these
  enhancements to IBPP Authors?
  
  YES. That is a clear duty that you agree on by making use of IBPP.  Though,
  of course, nobody obliges you to disclose any parts of your closed-source.
  It is then all upon you to find proper ways to let the community of users
  eventually benefit of any kind of enhancements you found useful for you,
  without divulging your trade secrets.  Suggestion: don't enhance IBPP
  source code itself with closed-source extensions.  Implement such extensions
  as a wrapper over IBPP interfaces or enhance IBPP itself with techniques
  such as hooks, which would then allow you to plug in your closed-source
  extensions while at the same time contributing some useful generic extensions
  mechanisms to IBPP.

o The IBPP previous versions up to and including versions 2.4.x were licensed
  under the Mozilla Public License, Version 1.0.  How does it come that this
  version uses a new licence?

  This new license doesn't remove any previous rights but is considerably
  easier to understand, live and work with.

  People might argue that the previous IBPP license had these terms in
  paragraph number 6.2: "No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the
  terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License" and that these
  terms should deny T.I.P. Group S.A. to replace the licensing model of IBPP
  with another license.  This is non-sense, in each and every way you can
  consider it and only comes from mistakenly having forgotten to remove and
  update "Netscape" references in the original license attached to the code.
  It is evident for anybody who would review the history of IBPP code, from its
  initial publication on SourceForge in year 2000 up to now, that the full
  initial code came solely from T.I.P. Group S.A. and is in no way related to
  'Netscape', nor are any contribution made to the code since its initial
  release related to 'Netscape'.

  Legal advice was seeked on this matter and it is under complete assurance
  that T.I.P. Group S.A. proudly republished IBPP source code under the above
  new license terms, for the increased benefit of all existing IBPP users and
  those to come.
